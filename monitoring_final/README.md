Invisible Monitoring for Elderly People

An intergration of commercial and handmade sensros that are non-intrusive. The purpose is to detect activity in home and record them in a database. We can aim to do many things with this data:
  - Make a smart home
    - The is controllable
    - Can remind you of important daily chores e.g. taking pills
    - Point our important hazards happening before they become inevitable
  - Inform someone in a case of inactivity
    - The activity measurment is compeletly customizable
    - You can add or remove different sensros to this rule
    - It is possbile to send an email, SMS, ... (future work)
  - Detect the pattern of the behaviours (future work)
    - So in any change of behaviour talk with a Doctor
    - Use these patterns to activate some actuators
